Gradient based CEM policy search

This algorithm algorithm has great potential. Not only for DDPG, the algorithm can adapt to any "Q-learning" style RL algorithm. With the support of the theory from GES, our algorithm may increase the performance of model based RL, by treating the learned gradient as surrogate gradient.
